## ðŸ”— Midtrans Integration

### Configuration

```javascript
// Midtrans Snap API Client
const midtransClient = new snap({
  isProduction: false,
  serverKey: process.env.MIDTRANS_SERVER_KEY,
  clientKey: process.env.MIDTRANS_CLIENT_KEY,
});
```

### Snap Transaction Parameters

```javascript
{
  transaction_details: {
    order_id: "BILLING-{id}" | "BILLING-MULTI-{userId}-{timestamp}" | "RAB-{id}",
    gross_amount: totalAmount
  },
  customer_details: {
    first_name: user.fullName,
    email: user.email,
    phone: user.noHP
  },
  item_details: [
    {
      id: billingId,
      price: amount,
      quantity: 1,
      name: description
    }
  ]
}
```

### Payment Status Mapping

| Midtrans Status | Action                                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `capture`       | Payment captured (credit card) - Mark as PAID |
| `settlement`    | Payment settled - Mark as PAID                |
| `pending`       | Payment pending - Keep as UNPAID              |
| `deny`          | Payment denied - Keep as UNPAID               |
| `cancel`        | Payment cancelled - Keep as UNPAID            |
| `expire`        | Payment expired - Keep as UNPAID              |

## ðŸ”” Webhook Handling

### Webhook Endpoint

- **URL**: `POST /api/payment-webhook`
- **Controller**: `controllers/payment.js`
- **Authentication**: Midtrans signature verification

### Order ID Routing Logic

```javascript
if (orderId.startsWith("RAB-")) {
  // Handle RAB (installation) payment
  await handleRabPayment(orderId, transactionStatus);
} else if (orderId.startsWith("BILLING-MULTI-")) {
  // Handle multiple billing payment
  await handleMultipleBillingPayment(orderId, transactionStatus);
} else if (orderId.startsWith("BILLING-")) {
  // Handle single billing payment
  await handleSingleBillingPayment(orderId, transactionStatus);
}
```

### Webhook Functions

#### 1. `handleSingleBillingPayment(orderId, status)`

- Extract `billingId` from `BILLING-{id}`
- Update billing status to PAID/FAILED
- **Decrement** `pemakaianBelumTerbayar` on success
- Create transaction record
- Send notification with appropriate link

#### 2. `handleMultipleBillingPayment(orderId, status)`

- Parse order ID: `BILLING-MULTI-{userId}-{timestamp}`
- Extract `userId` and `timestamp`
- Find all unpaid billings for user at that timestamp
- Update all billings to PAID/FAILED
- **Decrement** each billing's `pemakaianBelumTerbayar`
- Create multiple transaction records
- Send notification with appropriate link

#### 3. `handleRabPayment(orderId, status)`

- Extract `rabId` from `RAB-{id}`
- Update RAB connection status
- Create transaction record
- Send notification
